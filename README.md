Graduation Project
It has been researched that monthly and annual dependent variables are affected by import, intermediate, distance, gross domestic product, real effective exchange rate, and domestic PPI. In addition to the classical ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, Holt Winter's models, models were tested with Naive Bayes, GLM, SVM, RF algorithms were tested. When the results are analyzed, it is seen that the best results can be obtained with ARIMA and Holt Winter's for the first regression model by analyzing the values of MAE (mean absolute error) and RMSE (root mean square error).
